MBTA Station Entries and Exits 
========


Dynamic visualization of passenger entries and exits into MBTA red, orange, and blue line subway stations for the month of February 2014. Original data provided by the MBTA found in StationCountsByMinute_2014_02-01--03-02.csv. I created this graphic while interning with the MBTA in the summer of 2014.

The left side of the circles represent the number of passengers who entered the station in a given hour, and the right side of the circles represent the number of passengers who exited. Stations with many entries in the morning and many exits in the evening may be representative of areas where people reside. Stations with many exits in the morning and entries in the evening may be representative of areas where people work. The number of people exiting a station may be off by as much as 17% because passenger may exit a station without passing through a turnstyle or gate.
